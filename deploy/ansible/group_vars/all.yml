# Certain tasks may operate in a less secure (but more convenient) manner, eg.
# enabling passwordless sudo or generating self-signed ssl certs, when testing
# locally, in Vagrant. But not in production!
env: production

# This var is referenced by a few other vars, eg. git_repo, hostname, site_fqdn.
project_name: bots

# This is what you'll see at the bash prompt if/when you ssh into your server.
hostname: "{{project_name}}"

# This is the fully qualified domain name of your production server. Because
# nginx checks this value against the URL being requested, it must be the same
# as the server's DNS name. This value is overridden for Vagrant and staging
# servers.

# Parent directory for cloned repository directories. The clone_path and

# If defined, only this many of the most recent clone directories (including the

# If these variables are uncommented, add swap space to the machine when the
